    Project Notes
***********************************************************************************************

    when developing on windows and mac, the file systems 
    In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). 
    In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). 
    when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.

    the .gitignore helps tremendously with getting the project to run on both OS (mac + windows)

    About the Project
***********************************************************************************************

    Angry eels was developed by Griffin Atkinson
    the concept was to recreate the classic game "snake" but thought it would be fun 
    to add many modern features (it was!) 
    The name "angry eels" is to give it a unique spin and separate it from more basic snake games 
    also allow for a fun look for the graphics and audio
    
    Original game: The player controls snake that moves on a grid in 4 directions,
    the objective is to collect food that grows the snake one segment, 
    if the snake hits itself or a wall it dies and the game is over.

    Modern features:
    - game rules:
        - Customizable variables that control every aspect of the gameplay 
            (speed, food types + spawn rates, food growth, enable/disable features, eel colours, # of players, starting size, death timer, + many more)
        - gamemode preset feature that saves multiple "rule sets" for the player to choose from to jump in, 
            and also able to customize further if desired

    - gameplay:
        - advanced input system that allows the player to buffer vertical and horizontal inputs,
            allowing for much tighter controls
        - advanced gameplay loop that allows to check if eels collide theyll 
            both die instead of the first one trumping the latter
        - "ghosting" the eels on spawn for a set amount of time,
            to solve the problem of the player being trapped at spawn with an opstacle killing them on spawn
       

    - visuals and sounds:
        - in-game display for each player that displays information regarding thier score and
            indicators + timers for players to see the remaining duration and current status of their eel
        - visually appealing menu that allows user-friendly navigation of game information,
            and simple controls for customization of the game settings
        - menus and multiple screens (start/menu screen, advanced settings menu, pause menu, game screen)

    - features:
        - multiplayer! (up to 4 eels)
        - multiple game modes (race to # of points OR endless, where players play forever and try to set high scores)
        - pause game function
        - restart + return to menu functions
        - different varieties of food and spawning modes
        - fun statuses for the eels
        - optional death penalty for the players that disallow the players to move for a set amount of time after dying
        - visually appealing graphic animation for the eels and special effects for special statuses of the eels

    Ideas
***********************************************************************************************

    make bigger fish that can appear that can be eated in piece "leaving bones in the middle"
    "live" food / fish that can move slowly
    make number of lives
    make random obstacle maker, and preset stages to choose from.
    make high score file to keep reading from.

    make different levels 
        - different level sizes
        - obstacles,
        - warp pipes to other side of level

    add powerups (speed, grow a lot, untargettable)
    make options for food (multiple random spawning, single one that grows you then moves, toggle for dead snakes becoming food )
    golden food that moves/bounces around
