    when developing on windows and mac, the file systems 
    In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). 
    In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). 
    when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.

    the .gitignore helps tremendously with getting the project to run on both OS
   



    
    ***Snake Game 
    player story
    1 -> starts with GUI

    2 -> choose game settings
        -choose number of players
        -choose what players are human vs CPU
        -choose player's colours
        -choose game mode (regular - single food, hungry - multiple foods)
        -choose settings (do snakes turn into food when they die, do snakes respawn, grow amount, staring size, etc)
        -choose stage (original, preset map, or random obstacles)

    3 -> click start 

    4 -> GUI leaves and snake game is displayed

    5 -> player presses any key and game starts then continues indefinitely





       TODO
        -make a target score win the game
        +win screen

        -make when they run into each other, its not the first one that trumps the other

        -death penalty timer
        
        -pause button+function

    ideas
        make number of lives
        make random obstacle maker, and preset stages to choose from.
        make high score file to keep reading from.

        add powerups (speed, grow a lot, untargettable)
        make options for food (multiple random spawning, single one that grows you then moves, toggle for dead snakes becoming food )
        golden food that moves/bounces around
