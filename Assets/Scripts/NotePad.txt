    Project Notes
***********************************************************************************************

    when developing on windows and mac, the file systems 
    In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). 
    In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). 
    when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.

    the .gitignore helps tremendously with getting the project to run on both OS (mac + windows)

    About the Project
***********************************************************************************************

    Angry eels was developed by Griffin Atkinson
    the concept was to recreate the classic game "snake" but thought it would be fun 
    to add many modern features (it was!) 
    The name "angry eels" is to give it a unique spin and separate it from more basic snake games 
    also allow for a fun look for the graphics and audio
    
    Original game: The player controls snake that moves on a grid in 4 directions,
    the objective is to collect food that grows the snake one segment, 
    if the snake hits itself or a wall it dies and the game is over.

    Modern features:
    - game rules:
        - Customizable variables that control every aspect of the gameplay 
            (speed, food types + spawn rates, food growth, enable/disable features, eel colours, # of players, starting size, death timer, + many more)
        - gamemode preset feature that saves multiple "rule sets" for the player to choose from to jump in, 
            and also able to customize further if desired

    - gameplay:
       - advanced input system that allows the player to make difficult movements easily
            - buffers inputs so that the player does not need to be precise
            - can hold a direction to continue in that direction
            - while holding a movement can tap a sideways direction to move "one-step" 
                that direction before continuing the original direction
            - can hold two directions together to move in a "staircase" path automatically
            - can hold backwards then tap a side direction to automaticall u-turn

        - advanced game-handler movement loop that allows every snake to move in sync, while:
            - checking if eels collide (after moving them all)so theyll both die instead of the first one trumping the latter
            - eels cant collide with it's own tail (or tail of other eels, which you can in original snake game)

        - "ghosting" the eels on spawn for a set amount of time,
            to solve the problem of the player being trapped at spawn with an opstacle killing them on spawn
            ghosted eels cant harm other players or eat food
       

    - visuals and sounds:
        - in-game display for each player that displays information regarding thier score and
            indicators + timers for players to see the remaining duration and current status of their eel
        - visually appealing menu that allows user-friendly navigation of game information,
            and simple controls for customization of the game settings
        - menus and multiple screens (start/menu screen, advanced settings menu, pause menu, game screen)

    - features:
        - multiplayer! (up to 4 eels)
        - multiple game modes (race to # of points OR endless, where players play forever and try to set high scores)
        - pause game function
        - restart + return to menu functions
        - different varieties of food and spawning modes
        - fun statuses for the eels
        - optional death penalty for the players that disallow the players to move for a set amount of time after dying
        - visually appealing graphic animation for the eels and special effects for special statuses of the eels

    Ideas / Future Plans
***********************************************************************************************

    add computer players

    add animation for eels to open their mouths when they get close to food and eat when they get food

    add controller support

    add a big update to the types of food
    powerup to eat other snakes that  "cuts" them off where you intersect them, turning them into food
    make bigger fish that can appear that can be eated in piece "leaving bones in the middle"
    "live" food / fish that can move slowly

    pufferfish to avoid

    make number of lives

    make battle royale mode, where eels dont respawn untill theyre all dead

    make random obstacle maker, and preset stages to choose from.

    make different levels 
        - different level sizes
        - obstacles,
        - warp pipes to other side of level

    add powerups (speed, grow a lot, untargettable)

    make options for food (multiple random spawning, single one that grows you then moves, toggle for dead snakes becoming food )

    golden food that moves/bounces around?

    boss eel (2-3x the size of normal eel)

    Unfixable? Bugs
***********************************************************************************************
    was unable to manipulate "AdvancedOptionsScreen" through script at all debugs were saying it was moved when it wasnt
    changing the name to "AdvancedOptionsScreen (1)" fixed the issue entirely, changing it back still causes the issues
    very strange
